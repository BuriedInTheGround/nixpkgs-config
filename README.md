# My nix Home-Manager configuration

## Intro

Intro? Well, simply don't use this super-unreliable config! ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜²

## Requirements

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) installed (or maybe just having [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) it's ok, but I should test this...)
- Probably my [nixos-config](https://github.com/BuriedInTheGround/nixos-config) (I should check if there are dependencies...)

## Installation

- Clone this repo into `~/.config/nixpkgs`

      git clone https://github.com/BuriedInTheGround/nixpkgs-config.git ~/.config/nixpkgs

- Install Home-Manager: https://github.com/rycee/home-manager
